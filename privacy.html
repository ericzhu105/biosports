        This Privacy Policy describes how BioSports (“we”, “our”, or “us”) collects, uses, and protects information
        about you when you access or use our website, content, and services (collectively, the “Services”).
      </p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We collect information in three main ways:</p>
      <ul class="article-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Information you provide directly.</strong> For example, when you sign up to be notified about new
          episodes or events, contact us, or participate in surveys or promotions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Information collected automatically.</strong> When you use the Services, we may automatically collect
          certain information about your device and usage, such as IP address, browser type, operating system, referring
          URLs, pages viewed, and interaction patterns.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Information from partners.</strong> In some cases, we may receive limited information from
          distribution or analytics partners in order to understand engagement and performance.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Use of Information</h2>
      <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
      <ul class="article-list">
        <li>Operate, maintain, and improve the Services.</li>
        <li>Communicate with you about new content, events, or features you may be interested in.</li>
        <li>Monitor performance, troubleshoot issues, and protect the security of the Services.</li>
        <li>Understand aggregate usage trends to help shape future BioSports content and experiences.</li>
        <li>Comply with legal obligations and enforce our Terms and Conditions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
      <p>
        We may use cookies and similar technologies to help recognize your browser, remember your preferences, and
        understand how you interact with the Services. You can usually configure your browser to refuse cookies or
        indicate when a cookie is being sent, but some features of the Services may not function properly without them.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Email and Notifications</h2>
      <p>
        If you provide your email address through our “Get Notified” or similar forms, we may send you updates about new
        episodes, events, or BioSports initiatives. You can opt out of these communications at any time by using the
        unsubscribe link within the email or by contacting us directly.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell your personal information. We may share information in the following limited circumstances:
      </p>
      <ul class="article-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Service providers.</strong> With third-party vendors who help us operate the Services (for example,
          form processing, analytics, or email delivery), subject to appropriate confidentiality and data protection
          obligations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legal and safety.</strong> When we believe disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with
          applicable laws, regulations, legal processes, or government requests, or to protect the rights, property, or
          safety of BioSports, our users, or the public.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Business transitions.</strong> In connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of
          assets, subject to continued protection of your information consistent with this Policy.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain information for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Policy,
        unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. We also may retain certain information in
        aggregated or de-identified form that does not reasonably identify you.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Your Choices</h2>
      <p>You have several choices regarding your information:</p>
      <ul class="article-list">
        <li>
          You can opt out of marketing emails at any time by using the unsubscribe link in the message or contacting us.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can disable cookies in your browser settings, though this may affect functionality of some parts of the
          Services.
        </li>
        <li>
          Where applicable law provides, you may have rights to access, correct, or delete certain information about
          you. You can contact us to submit such a request.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect your information. No
        method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure, and we cannot
        guarantee absolute security.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        The Services are not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal
        information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected such information, we will take reasonable
        steps to delete it.
      </p>

      <h2>10. International Users</h2>
      <p>
        If you access the Services from outside the country where our systems are based, your information may be
        transferred, stored, and processed in a country with data protection rules that are different from those of your
        country. By using the Services, you consent to this transfer, storage, and processing.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in technology, law, or our practices.
        When we do, we will revise the “Effective Date” at the top of this page. Your continued use of the Services
        after any changes signifies your acceptance of the updated Policy.
      </p>
